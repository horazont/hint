Considerations:

* ADC (12 bit+?)
* Pinout
* Programmability
* Solderability

Options:

1. STM32 F101/F103

   * Hardware is commendable; it has everything.

   * Programmability may be an issue, but apparantly isnâ€™t.

   * Solderability may be an issue.

   F103: 1 advanced control timer, TIM2..TIM5 -> 4 timers + 1 advanced

   RTC, DMA, ADC, IWDG, WWDG, SPI, I2C, USART,


2. AVR (DIL/DIP packages)

   * Expensive considering features

   * Programmability and solderability is trivial
